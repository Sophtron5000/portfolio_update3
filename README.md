# Portfolio Update May 2022

## Description 

Welcome my developer portfolio, Sophia Custodia. It showcases my recent projects and links for potential employers to try out. I also includes my resume, contact information, and my photo. 

The technology used was HTML and advanced CSS, utilizing Bootstrap. Html was used to build the basic outline of my portfolio, the document includes semantic HTML and detailed content within. The HTML document is linked to a reset.css and a style.css. The purpose for the reset.css is to reset any browsers default css elements, allowing any browser to style according to the included style.css. 
Bootstrap was primarily used to style my portfolio because it has the largest ecosystem of components and utilities. Css selectors were used to incorporate a universal color palette and font styling. `!important` was used to override default bootstrap styling. 
Media queries  were used to ensure my portfolio displays well on smaller screens.  Google Fonts were also implemented.
